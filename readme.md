Problem:
The system that is being created will serve the function of a door lock with user authentication to grant access and video recording accompanied by a phone application and website were the events (movement and people entering) and the recordings will be viewable by the user. A stakeholder would have a door that leads to an area that is meant to have restricted access that only authorised people should be able to access, whilst also recording all events. The events that are being recorded should be anything that happens outside the door, being detected by an infra-red motion detector. All of the events will be recorded, whether that be someone entering or someone trying to enter or tamper with the door. The system should unlock the door when an authorised person wishes to go in, being checked by a RFID card reader. All the information should then be available for the stakeholder in an app or website, with events being displayed, whether it was someone entering or movement outside accompanied with video recordings of what happened.
Advantages over non computational method:
By using a microcomputer, the movement of each person is automatically recorded, meaning if they attempt to access the area there will be a record of this accompanied by a recording to show what they did, this is not possible to achieve this with a non-computational method. The video recordings and log will be saved to a sever providing easy access to the video recordings and logs, through the website or phone app or the. Neither of which would be possible with a no computational method such as a pen and paper sign in sheet. Furthermore, if the door had to be locked at all times apart from when someone authorised needs to enter, then the key would have to be given to everyone who can enter or have someone at the door at all times to unlock it for them. The possible issue with someone having the key is that it may get taken from them, this issue could happen with a RFID card however a second factor of authentication could be put in place with each user having an individual code that is liked to their card, meaning that both parameters have to be met to allow access.
There is a clear advantage of the job being done by a commuter system over a human, and this is that you do not need someone at the entrance of the door all the time, and it in most cases can be unmanaged, with video recording and complete logs. If a human were to do this job, then there would be lots of functions for them, including noting down everyone who enters, unlocking the door as well as making sure that people entering the area are authorised to do so, all of which is easily achievable by a computer system.
